📊 Dataset
Source: Electric vehicle population by county
File: Electric_Vehicle_Population_By_County.csv
Content: Contains EV registration data by geography and time, used for training the demand prediction model.

🧹 Preprocessing
Removed missing or duplicate records
Aggregated population data by time (monthly/yearly)
Saved as preprocessed_ev_data.csv 

🤖 Model
A time series forecasting model was trained to predict EV charging demand
The trained model is saved as: forecasting_ev_model.pkl

📈 Notebook Overview
EV_Vehicle_Charge_Demand_Prediction.ipynb includes:
Data loading and exploration
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Model training and forecasting
Visualizations of historical and predicted demand
Model export to .pkl
Data export to .csv

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.)
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab
Install dependencies (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, joblib, sklearn/statsmodels)
Run the notebook step-by-step
